Structural Design Patterns
=============


Welcome to the Structural Design Patterns repository! 🎉 This repository contains examples, explanations, and use cases of popular structural design patterns in software development. Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects to simplify relationships, improve flexibility, and enhance code reusability.

### 🔍 What Are Structural Design Patterns?


Structural design patterns describe how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. They ensure that systems are easier to manage, scalable, and maintainable by focusing on how entities relate to and interact with each other.

### Common Structural Design Patterns:
                    
                    
| **Pattern** | **Description** | **Example Use Case** |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Adapter** | Converts an interface into another interface clients expect. | Integrating legacy systems with modern APIs. |
| **Bridge** | Decouples abstraction from implementation to enable independent changes. | Separating device logic from its control mechanism. |
| **Composite** | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. | File systems or UI hierarchies. |
| **Decorator** | Adds behavior dynamically to objects without altering their structure. | Adding toppings to a pizza object. |
| [**Facade**](https://open.substack.com/pub/learningknowledge/p/facade-pattern?r=1v93yw&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) | Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code. | Universal remotes for home automation. |
| [**Flyweight**](https://learningknowledge.substack.com/p/structural-design-pattern-flyweight?r=1v93yw) | Reduces memory usage by sharing common data between similar objects. | Optimizing game assets like sprites or fonts. |
| **Proxy** | Provides a placeholder to control access to another object. | Access control, lazy loading, or remote access. |
