FACADE DESIGN PATTERN:

- It is a cool design pattern that cleans up your interaction with complex systems.
- Provides simple interface to complex system
- Minimizes Communication between dependencies between systems. 
- It is more like a helper for the client applications.  It doesn't hide subsystem interfaces from the client. Whether to use facade or not is completely dependent on client code.
Real Use Case : 
1. Hotel Frontdesk which communicates to other departments without the guest knowing what is happening at the backend of other department.
2. Start Button on Computer which takes care of staring and all the system components are loaded in the memory and ready to use.
	for example, loading the boot sector from the hard drive, loading the OS into memory, and initializing the CPU
